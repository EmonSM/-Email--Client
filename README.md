# Email-Client
This is the client portion of an email-like java program which allows LAN network users to communicate with each other. The client acts at the graphical interface for each individual user and lets them send and receive messages. The client also contains an inbox and outbox to show previously sent and received messages. The address of every client is the local ip address of their machine, which can be found using “ipconfig” command within cmd on Windows machines. Program has only been tested on Windows machines.
